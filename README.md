## Landing-Page Project
- This is a project landing page website to be used for my portfolio.

### Design

- I designed my layout in Figma. Check out the design here https://www.figma.com/file/Qie4VplppRwkFzn1ZcQuWbRR/Landing-Page?node-id=0%3A1

### Technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS/CSS3
- Vanilla Javascript

### Struggles:

#### HTML
 - Not that much
 - Only tricky part is how to enclose items/contents in its containers
#### CSS
 - Positioning is really tricky
 - Styling the dropdown menu for Services
 - Styling the get started button with its email container
 - Styling the Features tab
 - Getting the modal for the Designs section to work
 - Using transitions/animations to make the site interactive
 - Finding alternative methods/hacks to get the styling to work on different browsers
 - Getting the content to not overflow into another section
 - Getting the website to be mobile responsive without using css frameworks
 - Was supposed to add a preloader to the website but I couldn't get the site to load up in IE11 so I decided to remove it
#### Javascript
 - Trying to find a way to make smoothscroll work without using a plug-in but ended up using one
 - Struggled applying the scroll effect on the navigation bar but eventually was able to refactor the code to get it to work
 - Couldn't get the polyfill for the classList(add/remove) to work in IE
 - The "Scroll to Contact section when you click the Get Started button" was going to take me time to code in pure javascript so ended up using the scrollIntoView property eventhough browser support is limited.
